1.4 Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. 

Because we know that a palindrome has to have matching letters and only one letter that does not have a match,
if we save the unmatched letters to a set (mySet) then we can see if the lenght of that set is greater than 1.
If mySet is greater than 1, then logically we know that it cannot be a palindrome.

def permutation_palindrome(string):
    mySet = set()
    for char in string.lower():
        if char in mySet:
            mySet.remove(char)
        else:
            mySet.add(char)
    if (len(mySet)) > 1:
        print ("This is not a palindrome")
    else:
        print("This is a Palindrome!")
